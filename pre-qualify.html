                <h4>Let's Take the Next Step, Get Prequalified!</h4>
                <p>Since many different factors determine which mortgage program is best for you, it is best to consult with a mortgage lender. A mortgage lender will help guide you through the process by asking some of the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>What are your current finances?</li>
                    <li>How long do you plan on living in your new home?</li>
                    <li>What are your future goals?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Once you've discussed your needs with one of our experienced mortgage lenders, they will be able to discuss financing options with you and work with you to get you pre-qualified.</p>
                <p>A Mortgage Lender will ask you about your income, available funds for a down payment if needed and more.</p>
                <p>Contact one of our local Mortgage Lenders to get started today!</p>

                <h4>Let us find the right home loan to fit your needs.</h4>
